# Cloud2Cloud

Cloud2Cloud is a repository designed to assist users in loading, displaying, and manipulating point cloud data in Google Colab. The repository provides a set of Python scripts and utilities to work with point cloud data, including reading point cloud files, visualizing point clouds, and performing various point cloud processing tasks.

## Features

- Loading point cloud data from various file formats (e.g., LAZ, LAS, Potree Octree format).
- Efficiently reading point cloud data within a specified bounding box.
- Visualizing point cloud data in Google Colab.
- Performing point cloud processing tasks, such as reclassification of points.

## Scripts

### `compressed_sensing.py`

This script demonstrates the concept of compressed sensing for point cloud data. It provides a Python implementation of compressed sensing techniques to reduce the size of point cloud data while preserving important features.

### `potree_reader.py`

This script provides a Python implementation for reading point cloud data stored in the Potree Octree format. It includes functions to read metadata, hierarchy, and point data from Potree `.bin` files. The script also demonstrates how to efficiently load point data within a specified bounding box.

### `laz_compression.py`

This script demonstrates the core concept of LAZ compression for point cloud data using pure NumPy. It provides a simplified implementation of the LAZ compression algorithm to reduce the size of point cloud data.

## Usage

The scripts in this repository can be used in Google Colab notebooks to work with point cloud data. Users can load point cloud data from various file formats, visualize the point cloud, and perform point cloud processing tasks directly in Google Colab.
