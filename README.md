# Cloud2Cloud

Cloud2Cloud is a repository designed to assist users in loading, displaying, and manipulating point cloud data in Google Colab. The repository provides a set of Python scripts and utilities to work with point cloud data, including reading point cloud files, visualizing point clouds, and performing various point cloud processing tasks.

## Features

- Loading point cloud data from various file formats (e.g., LAZ, LAS, Potree Octree format).
- Efficiently reading point cloud data within a specified bounding box.
- Visualizing point cloud data in Google Colab.
- Performing point cloud processing tasks, such as reclassification of points.

## Scripts

### `potree_reader.py`

This script provides functions to read point cloud data stored in the Potree Octree format. It includes functions to read metadata, hierarchy, and point data from Potree `.bin` files. The script also demonstrates how to efficiently load point data within a specified bounding box. The `read_metadata` function reads the metadata JSON file, the `read_hierarchy_bin` function reads the hierarchy information from the `hierarchy.bin` file, and the `read_octree_bin` function reads point data from the `octree.bin` file based on the specified bounding box.

## Usage

The scripts in this repository can be used in Google Colab notebooks to work with point cloud data. Users can load point cloud data from various file formats, visualize the point cloud, and perform point cloud processing tasks directly in Google Colab.
